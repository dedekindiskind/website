## Introduction

While I don't have any aspirations of becoming a web developer as of yet. I do have the desire to one day host a website which plays my blog posts and dicussions in my interests. This can also serve as a front end of myself for prospectus employers. A strong inspiration for the creation of my website can be attributed to my Mathematics Professor, Dr Daniel Murfet's website [The Rising Sea](http://therisingsea.org/) and Documentary Creator, [LEMMiNO](https://www.lemmi.no/).
