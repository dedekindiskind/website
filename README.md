## Introduction

While I don't have any aspirations of becoming a web developer as of yet. I do have the desire to one day host a website which plays my blog posts and dicussions in my interests. This can also serve as a front end of myself for prospectus employers. A strong inspiration for the creation of my website can be attributed to my Mathematics Professor, Dr Daniel Murfet's website <a href="http://therisingsea.org/" target="_blank">The Rising Sea</a> and documentary creator, <a href="https://www.lemmi.no/" target="_blank">LEMMiNO</a>.

## Blog Posts
As mentioned, one of the key purpose for the website is to publish blog posts. All opinions are my own. A directory for every blogposts can be found below or for a directory on the website can be found [here](blog_posts/blog_posts.html)
